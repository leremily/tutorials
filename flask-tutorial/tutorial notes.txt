The basic tutorial from the Flask documentation.
They have it available on a repo, but it was better to create it step by step rather than just read
through everything.
Filled in the code with comments on functionality that isn't obvious to a newcomer like myself.

I also made basic improvements where I could and it was obvious to do so, listed below.
1. In flaskr/__init__.py, made the try-except block actually do something.
2. The flaskr logo links back to the index

Flasks' suggested improvements:
    A detail view to show a single post. Click a postâ€™s title to go to its page. [Done!]
    Like / unlike a post.
    Comments.
    Tags. Clicking a tag shows all the posts with that tag.
    A search box that filters the index page by name.
    Paged display. Only show 5 posts per page.
    Upload an image to go along with a post.
    Format posts using Markdown.
    An RSS feed of new posts.
